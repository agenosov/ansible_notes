# Inproperly using of boolean variables may lead to syntax errors which could be cought during runtime
# Note how the required variable is defined from the 'caller' playbook.
# Here we try to test it for true in several ways

- debug: 
    msg: "{{interrupt}}"

- debug:
    msg: "We just tested if the var is actually equal to 'true'"
  when:
    - interrupt is defined
    - interrupt == true

# In the case below we explicitly cast the result of comparison - this's redundantly of course
#
- debug:
    msg: "We just tested if the var is true and casted the result to bool"
  when:
      - interrupt is defined
      - "{{ interrupt == true | bool }}"

# And now the variant which is to be considered as 'do not do this'
#
# Comment the fragment below and only after that the entire play would be finished

- debug:
    msg: "We can't be there due to syntax error"
  when:
      - interrupt is defined
      - interrupt is true
